## 🌟 What Makes Moodweaver Special?

Moodweaver brings AI characters to life with dynamically scripted emotions, evolving personalities, and dynamic storytelling.

### 🧠 **The Personality Orrery**
Our groundbreaking emotion engine gives AI characters persistent, evolving emotional states:
- **Dynamic Traits**: Trust, paranoia, humor, aggression - all shift based on your interactions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Characters genuinely react to praise, criticism, flirtation, and hostility  
- **Cathartic Events**: Witness dramatic personality shifts like "Paranoid Breakdown" or "Explosive Anger"
- **Environmental Awareness**: Characters' surroundings have some effect on their personality

### 🎯 **Intelligent Task System**
Characters aren't just reactive - they have **agency and goals**:
- AI-driven story controller creates compelling narrative arcs
- Task-based personality guidance keeps characters motivated
- Rich narrative framework with core tensions and hooks

## 🎮 Demo

```
👤 User: "You seem tense today..."

🤖 AI: *shifts uncomfortably, avoiding eye contact* 
    "Tense? I'm not— Look, just because I haven't been 
    sleeping doesn't mean anything's wrong."
    
    [Paranoia: ↑ | Trust: ↓ | Mood: Defensive]

👤 User: "I'm here if you want to talk."

🤖 AI: *shoulders relax slightly, glances up*
    "I... maybe I have been overthinking things. 
    It's just hard to know who to trust anymore."
    
    [Trust: ↑ | Paranoia: ↓ | Mood: Cautiously Hopeful]
```
